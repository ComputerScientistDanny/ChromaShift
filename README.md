#ChromaShift

The terrible code I wrote for ChromaShift during the Node Knockout. :D 

Keep in mind that this code was very hastily written and should definitely not be taken as something to mimic. Things are all over the place, there's lots of copy and pasting, and there are probably some bad decisions in there. Nevertheless it is an example of a complete and working game written in ClojureScript in just 48 hours.
